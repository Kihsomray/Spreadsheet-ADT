## Task
Your task in this project is to write a spreadsheet ADT and a program that allows the user
to assign formulas to cells, view the formulas in the cells of the spreadsheet, and view the
values computed for all the cells in the spreadsheet.

## Organization
Be sure to organize your files in a sensible way. You will need files for a stack, a queue,
an expression tree, a spreadsheet, and a variety of other files (such as one for the
application itself and probably a separate one for the GUI). 
## Submission
Turn in all code you wrote or used. You should turn in a report (hard copy) that will act
as a users manual (how to use the program) and a technical manual (describing the data
structures and algorithms you used). You should also turn in one page that lists what part
of the project each team member implemented. In addition, you will each individually
turn in a short report (one page at most) on what challenges you faced in this project and
what you learned from the project.
